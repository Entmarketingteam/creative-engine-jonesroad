```
BAD:  top-down product shot
GOOD: true 90-degree overhead shot looking straight down, the camera is
      perfectly parallel to the flat surface, products sit on a clean white
      marble surface, all products are oriented with labels facing upward
      toward camera, shadows fall consistently to the lower right at
      approximately 45 degrees from soft directional light, each item
      is separated by 2-3 inches of negative space
```

### Mirror reflection shot
```
BAD:  looking in the mirror
GOOD: the camera is positioned slightly behind and to the left of the subject,
      her reflection is visible in a round gold-framed mirror on the wall,
      her actual body is in the left quarter of the frame slightly out of
      focus seen from behind, her reflected face in the mirror is the focal
      point — sharp and well-lit, she makes eye contact with herself in the
      mirror, the mirror shows a reversed version of her including the
      product in her hand
```

---

## 13. VIDEO-SPECIFIC MOTION

### "Hold and show" (safest for all models)
```
BAD:  she shows the product to camera
GOOD: she holds the product steady at chin height with label facing camera,
      then slowly rotates her wrist 45 degrees to the right over 2 seconds
      to show the side of the product, then rotates back. Her arm and hand
      are the only things that move. Her facial expression is a steady
      slight smile. No head movement. Fixed camera, no camera motion.
```

### "Just finished applying" (avoids application motion)
```
BAD:  she finishes putting on the product
GOOD: she lowers the closed product from near her face down to chest height
      in one slow smooth motion over 2 seconds, her expression shifts from
      focused concentration to satisfied with a slight eyebrow raise,
      she glances from the mirror to the camera. One downward hand motion
      is the only action. Fixed camera.
```

### "One touch" application (if you must show contact)
```
BAD:  she applies the product to her face
GOOD: she brings the stick tip slowly toward her closed left eye over 2 seconds,
      makes contact with her eyelid for 1 second with no sliding or stroking
      motion — just a single stationary press, then pulls the stick straight
      away from her face over 1 second. Three total seconds of motion.
      Her head does not move. Fixed camera. Total contact time under 1 second.
```

### Talking to camera (UGC dialogue)
```
BAD:  she talks about the product to camera
GOOD: her body and hands remain completely still with the product held at
      chest height. Only her face moves — her lips, eyes, and subtle
      micro-expressions. She maintains direct eye contact with the camera
      lens while speaking. Occasional blink. Slight eyebrow movement for
      emphasis on key words. No head tilting, no hand gestures, no product
      motion. Fixed camera, no movement.
```

### Slow head turn (editorial)
```
BAD:  she turns to look at camera
GOOD: starting position — her face is in three-quarter profile looking to
      the left of frame. Over 3 seconds she slowly rotates her head toward
      camera until she faces directly forward. Her eyes lead the motion,
      reaching camera first, then her chin follows. She stops at center
      with a neutral confident expression and holds for 2 seconds.
      One smooth continuous rotation. No body movement below the neck.
      Fixed camera.
```

### Product pickup from surface
```
BAD:  she picks up the product from the table
GOOD: the product sits on the counter in the lower center of frame. Her right
      hand enters from the right side of frame, reaches down, and her fingers
      close around the product. She lifts it straight up about 6 inches then
      stops and holds it still. One downward reach, one upward lift. Total
      motion takes 3 seconds. Her hand enters the frame already open with
      fingers extended. Fixed camera looking at the counter surface.
```

---

## 14. TEXT / PACKAGING ACCURACY

### Single product label facing camera
```
BAD:  the product label is visible
GOOD: the product is oriented with the primary label panel facing directly
      toward camera at a perpendicular angle, the brand name text is
      centered in the visible portion and must be rendered sharp and
      accurately spelled, all text on the packaging matches the reference
      image exactly — do not invent additional claims, numbers, or
      ingredient lists not visible in the reference.
      Preserve all visible text exactly as in reference image.
```

### Multiple products with text
```
BAD:  three products arranged with labels showing
GOOD: three products in a row, each oriented so only the primary front label
      panel faces camera. The products are spaced far enough apart that no
      labels overlap or crowd each other. Only reproduce text that is clearly
      visible in each product's reference image. If text would be too small
      to render clearly at this distance, angle that product so the text
      is not visible rather than rendering garbled text.
      Accuracy of readable text is more important than showing all text.
```

### Box with text on multiple sides
```
BAD:  the product box with text visible
GOOD: the box is angled 15 degrees to show primarily the front face with
      a sliver of the right side visible. Only the front panel text needs
      to be accurate and readable. The right side text should be rendered
      at an angle where it is visible but naturally too angled to read
      clearly. Do not attempt to render clear text on multiple faces
      simultaneously. Front face text must match reference exactly.
```

## 16. TECH / ELECTRONICS / GADGETS

### Phone in hand — screen visible
```
BAD:  holding a phone showing the app
GOOD: she holds a black smartphone in her right hand, thumb on the left edge,
      four fingers wrapped around the back, the phone is tilted approximately
      15 degrees toward camera so the screen is visible. The screen shows a
      clean app interface with a white background, large text header, and
      two colored buttons — do not attempt to render small UI text or icons,
      keep screen content simple and bold. The phone screen is lit and
      slightly brighter than the ambient environment. Her thumb rests
      naturally on the side, not hovering over the screen.
      No cracked screen, no visible fingerprints on the glass.
```

### Laptop on desk — lifestyle context
```
BAD:  working on a laptop
GOOD: a silver laptop sits open at approximately 110 degrees on a clean
      wooden desk, the screen shows a blurred abstract gradient — do not
      render readable text or UI on the screen. Her hands rest on the
      keyboard with fingers in natural typing position, wrists slightly
      elevated. A white ceramic mug sits to the upper right of the laptop,
      a small potted plant in the upper left corner of the desk. The laptop
      keyboard keys are individual and evenly spaced. Warm afternoon light
      from the left creates a soft shadow behind the laptop.
      No brand logos visible on the laptop exterior.
```

### Earbuds / headphones — wearing
```
BAD:  wearing wireless earbuds
GOOD: a single white wireless earbud sits in her right ear, the earbud stem
      extends slightly downward along her jawline, the earbud body fits
      snugly in the ear canal opening. Her hair is tucked behind her right
      ear making the earbud fully visible. The left ear is bare for contrast.
      The earbud casts a tiny shadow inside her ear. The earbud surface
      has a matte white finish with a barely visible seam line.
      No brand text needed on the earbud. Her ear anatomy is natural
      with visible cartilage folds.
```

### Headphones over ears
```
BAD:  wearing headphones
GOOD: she wears over-ear headphones with a matte black finish, the padded
      ear cups cover her ears completely, the headband arches over the top
      of her head with even pressure — her hair is slightly compressed
      beneath the headband, a few strands poke up through the gap. The
      ear cushions create a slight indent on her cheeks where they press.
      The left ear cup has a subtle texture pattern visible. The headband
      has a natural curve that follows her head shape, not floating
      above her hair. A thin cable or no cable visible depending on model.
```

### Smartwatch on wrist — screen lit
```
BAD:  wearing a smartwatch showing fitness stats
GOOD: close-up of her left wrist, a black-cased smartwatch with a rectangular
      screen sits snugly on her wrist just above the wrist bone. The screen
      is lit showing a simple large number "8,432" in white text on a dark
      background with a green circular progress ring around the number —
      keep the screen content minimal and large, no small text or icons.
      The silicone band wraps around her wrist with the clasp on the
      underside, her skin is slightly indented where the band presses.
      The screen casts a faint glow on her inner wrist.
```

### Charging / plugging in
```
BAD:  plugging in the charger
GOOD: close-up of her right hand guiding a white USB-C cable toward the
      charging port on the bottom edge of a phone lying on a table.
      The cable tip is 1 centimeter from the port, not yet inserted.
      Her thumb and index finger pinch the cable connector, the cable
      curves naturally away to the right. The phone lies flat on a
      dark surface, screen facing up but off. One simple action frozen
      mid-moment. No distorted cable, no impossible angles.
```

### Tablet / iPad — drawing or browsing
```
BAD:  using a tablet
GOOD: she holds an iPad in landscape orientation in her left hand, gripping
      the left edge with her thumb on the screen bezel and four fingers
      behind. Her right hand holds a white stylus like a pen, the stylus
      tip hovers just above the screen surface. The screen shows a simple
      abstract watercolor in progress — soft blue and green washes, keep
      artwork loose and simple. The tablet is tilted toward her at about
      30 degrees from vertical. She looks down at the screen with a
      focused expression.
```

### Speaker / smart home device — on shelf
```
BAD:  smart speaker on a shelf
GOOD: a cylindrical matte gray smart speaker sits on a floating white oak
      shelf, centered. A small LED ring on the top surface glows soft blue.
      To the left of the speaker, two books are stacked horizontally with
      a small ceramic vase on top. To the right, a framed photo is propped
      against the wall. The speaker casts a soft shadow to the right on
      the shelf surface. The fabric mesh texture on the speaker body is
      visible with a fine woven pattern. The wall behind is warm white
      with subtle texture.
```

## 17. HOME GOODS / HOUSEHOLD

### Candle — lit and styled
```
BAD:  candle on a table
GOOD: a glass jar candle sits on a round wooden tray on a coffee table,
      the candle is lit with a single steady flame approximately 1 inch tall,
      the flame is slightly orange at the base transitioning to yellow at
      the tip, the wax pool around the wick is fully melted to the edges
      of the jar and slightly concave, the melted wax is translucent showing
      a warm honey color. A faint wisp of smoke is not visible — the flame
      is clean and steady. The glass jar has condensation-like warmth on the
      upper interior walls above the wax line. A closed book and a small
      succulent sit on the tray beside the candle.
```

### Bedding / sheets — styled on bed
```
BAD:  nice sheets on a bed
GOOD: a neatly but not perfectly made bed with cream linen sheets, the top
      sheet is folded back approximately 18 inches revealing the fitted sheet
      below in the same color, the fold creates a natural soft crease with
      slight wrinkling along the fold line. Two oversized white euro pillows
      lean against a light oak headboard, slightly overlapping. In front of
      them, two standard sleeping pillows in cream cases are stacked with the
      front one tilted slightly. The linen has a visible natural slub texture
      throughout. Morning light from the right casts a long shadow across
      the bed surface, creating warm and cool zones in the fabric.
```

### Towels — bathroom styled
```
BAD:  nice towels in a bathroom
GOOD: three white waffle-weave towels — one hung flat on a matte black towel
      bar showing its full drape with the bottom edge slightly uneven, one
      folded in thirds and placed on the edge of the vanity counter, and
      one loosely rolled and tucked into an open wicker basket on the floor.
      The waffle texture is visible on all three towels with small square
      indentations creating a grid pattern. The hung towel has a visible
      woven label tag at one corner. Warm bathroom lighting from above.
```

### Kitchenware — cookware on stove
```
BAD:  pan on the stove
GOOD: a matte black cast iron skillet sits on a gas burner, the burner is off
      and the grates are visible beneath the skillet. Inside the skillet,
      a light sheen of oil coats the cooking surface catching a highlight
      from the range hood light above. The skillet handle extends to the
      right at a slight angle, a folded gray linen kitchen towel is draped
      over the handle. The skillet has a slightly rough textured cooking
      surface with subtle seasoning marks. Adjacent burners are partially
      visible, one has a copper kettle on it slightly out of focus.
```

### Soap / hand wash — dispenser on counter
```
BAD:  soap dispenser in bathroom
GOOD: an amber glass soap dispenser with a matte black pump sits on a white
      marble bathroom counter to the right of the sink basin. A small pool
      of foam-like soap residue sits around the base where past pumps have
      dripped. The pump head catches a small highlight from the overhead light.
      Through the amber glass, the liquid soap level is visible at approximately
      two-thirds full. The soap inside has a slightly cloudy translucent
      quality. A small hand towel is folded beside it on the counter.
```

### Throw pillow — on sofa
```
BAD:  decorative pillow on a couch
GOOD: a textured bouclé throw pillow in cream sits propped against the arm
      of a gray linen sofa, the pillow is slightly compressed on the bottom
      where it meets the seat cushion, the upper corners are puffy and rounded.
      The bouclé texture is visible as small looped yarn knots across the
      entire surface creating an organic bumpy pattern. The pillow is slightly
      off-center leaning to the right. A second pillow in solid sage green
      sits behind it partially obscured. Natural light from the left creates
      a soft shadow on the right side of the pillow.
```

### Plant / planter — styled shelf
```
BAD:  plant on a shelf
GOOD: a small trailing pothos plant in a matte white ceramic pot sits on a
      floating wooden shelf, three vines cascade over the front edge of the
      shelf hanging down approximately 8 inches, each vine has heart-shaped
      leaves in varying sizes — larger near the pot, smaller at the vine tips.
      The leaves are a mix of deep green and lighter yellow-green variegation.
      The soil surface in the pot is visible with a thin layer of small white
      decorative pebbles on top. One leaf has a slight brown edge — a natural
      imperfection. The pot has a drainage saucer beneath it.
```

## 18. PET PRODUCTS

### Dog wearing collar / harness
```
BAD:  dog wearing the collar
GOOD: a medium-sized golden retriever sits on a hardwood floor facing camera,
      wearing a forest green nylon collar with a matte brass buckle and
      D-ring, the collar sits around the mid-neck area with approximately
      two fingers width of slack, the fur bunches slightly above and below
      the collar where it presses gently, the brass hardware catches a small
      highlight from the window light, one end of the collar has the loose
      tail of the strap with the branded end visible. The dog's tongue
      is slightly out, ears relaxed, eyes focused just above the camera.
      No leash attached.
```

### Cat with toy / product
```
BAD:  cat playing with the toy
GOOD: FROZEN MOMENT. A tabby cat lies on its side on a cream wool rug, both
      front paws extended forward gripping a small braided rope toy, the cat's
      claws are partially extended hooking into the rope fibers, the rope is
      slightly frayed at the ends from play. The cat's body is in a relaxed
      play position — rear legs slightly tucked, tail curved. Its eyes are
      wide and focused on the toy with dilated pupils. One ear is pointed
      forward, the other slightly to the side. Natural indoor light,
      a sofa leg is visible in the background out of focus.
```

### Pet food / bowl — mealtime
```
BAD:  dog eating from a bowl
GOOD: a stainless steel dog bowl sits on a gray silicone mat on a kitchen
      floor, the bowl is filled with brown kibble pieces mounded slightly
      above the rim in the center. A golden retriever's head is lowered
      toward the bowl with nose approximately 2 inches from the food, ears
      hanging forward. The kibble pieces are irregularly shaped — some round,
      some triangular, varying in shade from light to dark brown. A few
      stray kibble pieces have fallen onto the mat beside the bowl.
      The dog's collar is visible around its neck. Kitchen cabinets are
      blurred in the background.
```

### Dog leash in hand — walking
```
BAD:  walking the dog with the leash
GOOD: close-up of a person's right hand gripping a tan leather leash,
      the leash wraps once around her palm with the end held between her
      thumb and fingers, a brass clasp hangs below her hand where the leash
      extends downward and out of frame toward the dog. The leather has a
      natural grain texture and slight wear marks near the handle loop.
      Her hand is at hip height, wearing a casual green jacket sleeve
      visible at the wrist. Background is a blurred park path with grass
      on either side. The leash is taut at a slight angle forward
      indicating the dog is ahead and pulling gently.
```

### Pet bed — styled product shot
```
BAD:  dog bed in a living room
GOOD: a large oval-shaped dog bed with bolstered edges sits on a light oak
      hardwood floor next to a cream sofa. The bed has a soft sherpa-fleece
      interior in cream with a durable canvas exterior in olive green. The
      bolstered edge is compressed slightly on the left side where a dog
      habitually rests its head — showing use but clean. A few short golden
      dog hairs are visible on the fleece surface near the compressed area.
      A small knot toy sits in the bed near the right edge. The bed is
      large enough to see the interior surface clearly, afternoon light
      from a window creates a warm patch of light across half the bed.
```

### Pet supplement / treat — product hero
```
BAD:  dog treats and the bag
GOOD: a resealable kraft brown bag of dog treats stands upright on a wooden
      counter, the top is rolled down and clipped with a wooden bag clip,
      the front label faces camera with the brand name clearly readable.
      In front of the bag, five individual treats are scattered on the
      counter — irregularly shaped, slightly different sizes, with a rough
      crumbly texture in a dark brown color. One treat is broken in half
      showing the lighter interior cross-section. A golden retriever sits
      in the background behind the counter, slightly out of focus, looking
      at the treats with alert forward ears.
```

## 19. FITNESS / SPORTS EQUIPMENT

### Holding dumbbells — mid-exercise
```
BAD:  woman lifting weights
GOOD: FROZEN MOMENT mid-bicep curl. She stands facing camera, right arm bent
      at 90 degrees at the elbow holding a matte black 15lb dumbbell, the
      dumbbell is horizontal and parallel to the floor, her bicep is flexed
      with visible muscle definition, her grip wraps fully around the handle
      with knuckles facing the ceiling, her left arm hangs relaxed at her
      side holding a matching dumbbell. She wears a fitted dark gray tank
      top and black leggings. A thin layer of perspiration is visible on
      her forehead and upper arms catching the overhead gym light.
      No gym equipment in the background — clean neutral wall.
```

### Yoga mat — in use
```
BAD:  woman on a yoga mat
GOOD: she stands barefoot on a 6mm thick sage green yoga mat on a light
      hardwood floor, in tree pose — left foot pressed against her right
      inner thigh, hands together at heart center. The mat surface shows
      a subtle textured grip pattern, her toes grip slightly into the mat
      creating small compression marks. The mat edges are flat against the
      floor with no curling. She wears a fitted white ribbed tank and
      high-waisted olive green leggings. Morning light streams through
      a large window behind her creating a bright backlit rim on her
      silhouette. The room is minimal — white walls, one small plant
      in the corner.
```

### Resistance bands — in use
```
BAD:  using resistance bands
GOOD: she stands with feet shoulder-width apart, a teal fabric resistance band
      looped around both thighs just above her knees. She is in a quarter-squat
      position with knees pushed slightly outward against the band tension,
      the band is visibly stretched and taut between her thighs with the fabric
      slightly compressed where it contacts her legs. She wears black biker
      shorts and a cropped white tee. Her hands are clasped at chest height.
      The band fabric has a woven texture with a thin silicone grip strip
      visible on the inner surface where it contacts her skin.
      Shot from slightly below waist height to show the band clearly.
```

### Water bottle — gym context
```
BAD:  drinking from a water bottle at the gym
GOOD: she holds a matte black insulated water bottle in her right hand at
      mouth height, the bottle is tilted approximately 30 degrees with the
      mouth opening at her lips, her left hand rests on her hip. A thin
      stream of water is not visible — she is between sips with the bottle
      just touching her lower lip. The bottle surface has visible condensation
      droplets, a carabiner clip hangs from the bottle cap loop. She wears
      a fitted heather gray athletic top with subtle sweat darkening at the
      collar. Her hair is in a high ponytail slightly messy from exercise.
      Background is a blurred gym wall with a small section of mirror visible.
```

### Foam roller — in use
```
BAD:  using a foam roller
GOOD: she lies on her right side on a yoga mat, a textured black foam roller
      positioned beneath her right outer thigh / IT band, her right leg is
      extended straight with her body weight pressing into the roller. Her
      left foot is planted flat on the floor in front of her right knee for
      stability, both hands are on the floor in front of her for support.
      The foam roller has a ridged grid texture pattern visible where it's
      not compressed by her leg. Her expression shows mild effort and
      concentration. The roller compresses slightly under her body weight
      showing its density. She wears black leggings and a fitted gray tank.
```

### Running shoes — action shot
```
BAD:  running in sneakers
GOOD: FROZEN MOMENT mid-stride. Shot from ground level looking slightly upward.
      Her right foot is in the air mid-swing with the sole of the shoe visible,
      the shoe is a light gray mesh running shoe with a white foam midsole and
      teal accent stripe, the shoe laces are tied and the tongue sits centered.
      Her left foot is planted on asphalt with the shoe compressing slightly
      at the forefoot showing flex in the sole. The mesh upper shows fine
      woven detail. Her black leggings are visible from mid-calf up. The
      background is a blurred outdoor path with trees. Motion blur on the
      right foot suggests movement while the planted left foot is sharp.
```

### Jump rope — product shot
```
BAD:  jump rope on the floor
GOOD: a black speed jump rope coiled in a loose organic spiral on a light gray
      concrete floor, the handles are matte black with knurled grip texture
      and sit at the top of the coil slightly overlapping. The thin steel
      cable is coated in black and catches highlights along its curves.
      The coil is intentionally imperfect — not a perfect circle but a
      casual toss-down arrangement with one loop crossing over another.
      A pair of white running shoes sits beside the rope slightly out of
      focus, one shoe upright and one on its side. Overhead gym lighting
      creates clean even illumination.
```

## 20. BABY / KIDS PRODUCTS

### Baby held by parent — product visible
```
BAD:  mom holding baby with the product
GOOD: a woman in her early 30s holds a baby approximately 6 months old against
      her left shoulder, the baby faces camera with cheek resting on her
      shoulder, her left arm supports the baby's bottom and her right hand
      holds a small tube of diaper cream at hip height with the label facing
      camera. The baby wears a white cotton onesie, the woman wears a
      soft gray crew neck tee. Her hair is in a loose low bun. The baby
      has soft fine hair and round cheeks with natural baby skin — slightly
      flushed at the cheeks. Background is a nursery — a white crib rail
      is partially visible, warm soft overhead light.
      No extra limbs on the baby, no distorted proportions.
```

### Kids toy — in use
```
BAD:  child playing with the toy
GOOD: FROZEN MOMENT. A child approximately age 4 sits cross-legged on a
      colorful play mat, both hands gripping a wooden stacking toy — left
      hand holds the base stable, right hand is placing a yellow ring onto
      the center post, the ring is halfway down the post. Three rings are
      already stacked on the post in order — red on bottom, blue, then green.
      Two more rings sit on the mat beside the toy waiting to be stacked.
      The child looks down at the toy with focused concentration, mouth
      slightly open. Wearing a striped long-sleeve tee and soft pants.
      Natural playroom light, other toys slightly visible in the background.
```

### Baby skincare — application
```
BAD:  putting lotion on the baby
GOOD: close-up of a parent's hands — the left hand gently holds a baby's
      bare foot, the baby's leg is chubby with natural skin folds at the
      ankle and knee. The right hand has a small white dollop of cream on
      the index and middle fingertips, the fingers are about to make contact
      with the baby's shin — not yet touching. The baby's skin is smooth
      with a natural slight pink flush. The cream is thick and white and
      sits as a defined dollop on the fingertips. The changing pad surface
      is visible in the background — a soft gray padded surface.
      The parent's hands have natural adult skin texture for contrast
      with the baby's smooth skin.
```

### Stroller — outdoor lifestyle

BAD:  woman pushing a stroller
GOOD: a woman in her early 30s walks on a paved park path pushing a
      modern matte black stroller with gray fabric seat, shot from a
      three-quarter angle showing both the woman and the stroller profile.
      Her right hand grips the handlebar, left arm swings naturally mid-stride.
      The stroller has visible wheels on a textured path surface — the front
      wheel is slightly turned indicating a gentle curve in the path.
      A baby's legs are barely visible in the stroller seat, wearing small
      white shoes. A diaper bag hangs from the handlebar hooks. She wears
      a camel-colored coat and white sneakers. Autumn trees line the path
      slightly out of focus, overcast soft light.

## 21. AUTOMOTIVE / CAR ACCESSORIES

### Phone mount on dashboard
```
BAD:  phone mounted on the car dashboard
GOOD: a smartphone sits in a matte black magnetic car mount attached to the
      air vent of a modern car dashboard, the phone screen is lit showing
      a simple navigation map with a blue route line — keep map content
      simple with no readable street names. The mount grips the vent slats
      firmly with visible clip mechanism. The dashboard is dark gray with
      a clean modern design, the steering wheel is partially visible in
      the lower left. Through the windshield, a blurred road and sky are
      visible. The phone is in portrait orientation, slightly tilted toward
      the driver. Natural daylight fills the car interior.
```

### Car seat cover — installed
```
BAD:  car seat cover in a car
GOOD: the front passenger seat of a car has a fitted neoprene seat cover in
      charcoal gray, the cover is stretched tautly over the seat with clean
      seams visible along the sides, the headrest has a separate fitted cover
      that matches. The cover fabric shows a subtle quilted diamond pattern.
      The seat belt emerges cleanly through a reinforced slot in the side of
      the cover. The car interior is a lighter gray creating contrast with
      the darker cover. The cover wraps smoothly around the seat contours
      with slight tension wrinkles at the hip bolster areas where the seat
      curves. Shot from the open passenger door looking in.
```

### Dash cam — mounted on windshield
```
BAD:  dash cam in the car
GOOD: a small black dash cam approximately 2 inches wide is mounted on the
      upper center of the windshield via a suction cup mount, the lens
      faces forward through the glass, a small red LED indicator light
      glows on the front face. The camera body is compact and low-profile
      against the windshield. A thin black power cable runs from the camera
      along the headliner edge and disappears behind the A-pillar trim.
      Through the windshield, a suburban road scene is visible but slightly
      out of focus. The rearview mirror hangs just to the right of the
      camera. Shot from the driver's perspective looking slightly upward.
```

## 22. OFFICE / PRODUCTIVITY

### Desk setup — product in context
```
BAD:  clean desk with the product
GOOD: a minimalist wooden desk surface with a 27-inch monitor on a slim
      monitor arm in the background, a wireless keyboard and mouse in the
      mid-ground, and the product centered in the foreground at the front
      edge of the desk. The product is sharp and in focus while the monitor
      shows a blurred abstract screen. A small concrete pen cup holds three
      pens to the left, a closed notebook with a pen resting diagonally on
      top sits to the right. A desk lamp with a matte black arm is positioned
      at the upper left, turned on casting warm directional light across
      the desk from left to right. The desk surface shows natural wood
      grain. A few small items suggest real use — a sticky note, a
      loose paper clip.
```

### Planner / notebook — in use
```
BAD:  writing in a planner
GOOD: a hardcover planner lies open on a wooden desk, the left page shows
      a weekly spread with some handwritten entries in neat blue ink — keep
      the handwriting loose and natural, not perfect, 3-4 lines of
      indecipherable script suggesting real notes. The right page is partially
      filled. Her right hand holds a fine-tip black pen positioned mid-line
      as if she just paused writing. Her left hand rests on the left page
      holding the planner open flat. The pen is held in a natural tripod
      grip. A coffee mug and her phone sit nearby on the desk.
      The planner binding is visible in the center gutter.
```

### Packing / shipping — small business
```
BAD:  packing orders
GOOD: a kraft brown shipping box sits open on a white table, half-packed
      with white crinkle paper fill. Her left hand holds a product wrapped
      in tissue paper, lowering it into the box. Her right hand steadies the
      box edge. A stack of three more boxes sits to the right, folded flat.
      A tape dispenser, a roll of branded stickers, and a small pile of
      thank-you cards are arranged on the table to the left. One branded
      sticker is already applied to a sealed box in the background stack.
      The workspace is bright and organized but lived-in — a pen is out
      of place, one sticker is peeling slightly off its sheet.
```

---

## 23. TRAVEL / LUGGAGE / BAGS

### Suitcase — packed and styled
```
BAD:  open suitcase packed for a trip
GOOD: a hard-shell carry-on suitcase in matte olive green lies open on a bed,
      the bottom half is neatly packed with rolled clothing — visible items
      include a white tee, a navy sweater, and folded jeans arranged in
      a grid pattern. The top half has a zippered mesh divider partially
      open revealing toiletries in a clear pouch. A pair of sunglasses
      rests on top of the folded clothes. The suitcase interior lining
      is a neutral tan fabric. One shoe (white sneaker) is tucked sole-up
      in the corner. The telescoping handle is retracted. The bed surface
      around the suitcase shows a few items not yet packed — a book,
      a phone charger coiled loosely.
```

### Backpack — lifestyle
```
BAD:  wearing a backpack outdoors
GOOD: shot from a three-quarter rear angle, she wears a medium-sized canvas
      backpack in faded olive on both shoulders, the straps are adjusted
      snugly with about 2 inches of excess strap hanging from the adjusters,
      the backpack sits high on her back with the bottom edge at her mid-back.
      A water bottle is visible in the side mesh pocket. The top flap buckle
      is fastened. She walks on a dirt trail with trees on both sides slightly
      out of focus. She wears a cream-colored jacket and dark jeans, her
      hair is in a loose ponytail visible between the shoulder straps.
      The canvas fabric shows natural texture and slight fading at the
      stress points on the bottom corners.
```

### Toiletry bag — contents visible
```
BAD:  toiletry bag with products
GOOD: a brown leather toiletry bag sits unzipped on a white marble bathroom
      counter, the bag is open with the two halves spread apart revealing
      the interior. Inside: a small amber glass bottle stands upright in
      a pocket, a silver tube of toothpaste lies flat, a clear glass jar
      of cream is visible, and a wooden-handled toothbrush is tucked
      in an elastic loop. The bag's interior lining is a waterproof
      tan canvas. One product — a small spray bottle — sits on the counter
      beside the bag as if just removed. The leather exterior has a natural
      grain with a brass zipper pull resting at the right side of the
      opening. Morning bathroom light from the right.
```

---

## 24. SUPPLEMENTS / WELLNESS

### Pill bottle — lifestyle context
```
BAD:  supplement bottle on a kitchen counter
GOOD: a white supplement bottle with a black cap stands on a light wood
      kitchen counter next to a clear glass of water with a lemon slice.
      The bottle label faces camera with brand text clearly readable —
      preserve text exactly from reference. Two capsules sit on the counter
      beside the bottle — translucent amber gel caps with visible oil inside,
      one capsule rests flat and the other is slightly angled against the
      first. The bottle cap is off and sits upside-down on the counter behind
      the bottle. Morning light from a window to the left, a blurred
      fruit bowl is barely visible in the background. The counter has a
      few natural crumbs and marks showing real kitchen use.
```

### Powder supplement — scoop in jar
```
BAD:  protein powder with a scoop
GOOD: overhead shot of an open white tub of powder, the lid removed and set
      beside the tub. Inside, the powder is a pale green (matcha-colored)
      with a slightly uneven surface — not perfectly flat, showing that
      scoops have been taken. A plastic scoop sits in the powder at an angle,
      the scoop bowl is filled with a heaping mound of powder, a few grains
      have spilled onto the surface around the scoop. The powder has a fine
      milled texture, not chunky or clumpy. The tub label is visible on
      the side facing camera. A shaker bottle with the lid off sits
      beside the tub on the white counter.
```

### Gummy supplements — lifestyle
```
BAD:  gummy vitamins in her hand
GOOD: her open left palm faces upward at chest height, three gummy vitamins
      sit in the center of her palm — two orange bear-shaped gummies and
      one yellow one, each approximately 1 centimeter tall, the gummies
      have a slightly translucent quality with a light sugar coating that
      catches the light. Her fingers are slightly curled inward creating
      a natural cup shape. Her right hand holds the supplement bottle at
      her side with the label visible. She looks at the gummies in her
      palm with a slight smile. The gummies are soft and slightly squishy
      in appearance, not hard candy-like.
```

### Collagen / drink mix — being mixed
```
BAD:  mixing collagen powder into coffee
GOOD: FROZEN MOMENT. A clear glass mug of hot black coffee sits on a counter,
      she holds a single-serve sachet of collagen powder torn open at the top,
      tilted over the mug at a 45 degree angle. A stream of white powder is
      mid-fall between the sachet opening and the coffee surface — the stream
      is approximately 2 inches long and slightly dispersing. Where the
      powder has already hit the coffee surface, small white swirls and
      undissolved clusters float on top. The sachet is pinched between
      her right thumb and index finger, the torn edge is ragged.
      Steam from the coffee is slightly visible.
```

---

## 25. CLEANING / HOUSEHOLD CONSUMABLES

### Spray bottle — in use
```
BAD:  spraying the cleaner
GOOD: her right hand grips a spray bottle with index and middle finger on the
      trigger, the nozzle is aimed at a kitchen counter surface approximately
      8 inches away. A cone-shaped mist is frozen mid-spray between the nozzle
      and the counter — the mist is fine and slightly visible against the dark
      counter surface, wider at the counter end than at the nozzle. The
      counter already has a small wet patch where previous sprays have landed.
      Her left hand holds a folded white microfiber cloth at her side.
      The spray bottle is a frosted glass or white plastic with a minimalist
      label facing camera. Natural kitchen lighting from overhead.
```

### Laundry detergent — pouring
```
BAD:  pouring laundry detergent
GOOD: FROZEN MOMENT. She holds a white bottle of laundry detergent tilted at
      45 degrees with her right hand, pouring clear blue liquid into the
      detergent cup held in her left hand. The liquid stream connects bottle
      to cup, the cup is approximately half-full with the blue liquid slightly
      foaming on the surface. The bottle label faces camera, readable. Behind
      her, a modern front-loading washing machine is visible with the door
      open, the stainless steel drum interior visible. She is leaning
      slightly forward looking at the cup to measure correctly.
      The laundry area has white walls and a small shelf with folded towels.
```

### Dish soap — at the sink
```
BAD:  doing dishes with the soap
GOOD: close-up of her hands at a kitchen sink, her left hand holds a white
      ceramic plate under running water, her right hand holds a yellow
      sponge with a layer of white suds on the sponge surface. The plate
      has soap suds on one half and is clean and wet on the other half where
      she has already scrubbed. The stainless steel sink has a few other
      dishes in the background — a bowl and a glass. The dish soap bottle
      stands on the counter behind the sink with the label facing camera.
      Running water from a chrome faucet is visible as a thin clear stream
      hitting the plate. Natural light from a window above the sink.
```

---

## 26. FRAGRANCE / PERFUME

### Perfume bottle — hero product shot
```
BAD:  perfume bottle on a surface
GOOD: a glass perfume bottle sits on a white marble surface, the glass is
      clear showing the pale gold liquid inside filled to approximately
      three-quarters, the liquid has a subtle meniscus where it meets the
      glass walls. The cap is a heavy gold-tone metal sitting beside the
      bottle, the atomizer spray nozzle is exposed. The bottle catches
      and refracts light creating a subtle caustic light pattern on the
      marble surface behind it. A single soft shadow falls to the right.
      The front face of the bottle has an embossed or printed brand name —
      preserve text exactly from reference. The bottle edges create visible
      glass thickness and slight green tint typical of real glass.
```

### Spraying perfume — on wrist
```
BAD:  spraying perfume on her wrist
GOOD: she holds a perfume bottle in her right hand approximately 4 inches above
      her exposed left inner wrist, her left arm is extended with wrist turned
      upward. Her right index finger presses the atomizer — a fine visible mist
      cone sprays downward toward her wrist, the mist is slightly visible
      against the dark background as a translucent cloud approximately 3 inches
      in diameter. Her wrist skin shows a slight wet sheen from previous sprays.
      The bottle is oriented with the label facing camera. She looks downward
      at her wrist with a subtle pleasant expression. Background is a bedroom,
      warm soft morning light. Shot at chest-to-face framing.
```

### Perfume in context — vanity styling
```
BAD:  perfume on a vanity
GOOD: a perfume bottle sits on a mirrored vanity tray alongside other curated
      items — a small ceramic ring dish with two thin gold rings, a dried
      rose stem, and a tiny votive candle (unlit). The tray is rectangular
      with an antiqued brass frame. The perfume bottle is the tallest item
      and sits at the back center of the tray, the other items arranged in
      front of it at varying heights. The mirrored tray surface creates a
      subtle reflection of each item below it. The vanity surface is white
      marble. Soft diffused light from the right, warm and feminine but not
      overly pink. Each item casts a soft shadow to the left.
```

---

## 27. HAIR CARE

### Shampoo / conditioner — in shower
```
BAD:  shampoo bottle in the shower
GOOD: a tall white bottle of shampoo sits on a teak shower bench or built-in
      shelf, water droplets cover the bottle surface catching light, a few
      drops trail down the side. The shower wall behind is white subway tile
      with visible grout lines and water running down in thin sheets. A
      second matching conditioner bottle stands beside it, slightly smaller.
      The bench has visible water pooling in the natural wood grain. A small
      loofah or washcloth sits to the side. The lighting is bright and clean
      from an overhead shower light, the bottles' labels face camera and
      are readable despite the water droplets partially obscuring some text.
      Steam is faintly visible in the upper portion of the frame.
```

### Styling product — in hair
```
BAD:  putting product in her hair
GOOD: she faces a bathroom mirror, both hands in her damp hair at approximately
      ear level, her fingers are spread and threaded through sections of
      hair mid-scrunch. Her hair is visibly damp — slightly darker than dry
      and clumped in natural wave patterns. A small amount of white product
      foam is visible on her right palm and distributed through the hair
      sections she is holding. Her expression is focused, looking at herself
      in the mirror. She wears a towel wrapped around her torso. The product
      bottle sits on the counter in the foreground with the label readable.
      Bright bathroom lighting, mirror reflection shows the back of her head.
```

### Hair tool — straightener / curling iron
```
BAD:  using a hair straightener
GOOD: she holds a matte black flat iron in her right hand, clamped onto a
      section of hair approximately 2 inches wide at mid-shaft, the plates
      of the iron are closed around the hair section and positioned about
      3 inches from her head. Her left hand holds the hair taut below the
      iron, pulling the section straight. The cord extends from the bottom
      of the iron and drapes out of frame. She faces a mirror at a slight
      angle with her chin lifted to give access to the section she is
      styling. The already-straightened sections of hair hang smooth and
      sleek on the opposite side of her head for contrast with the
      un-styled sections. A faint wisp of heat haze (not smoke) is
      barely visible near the iron plates.
```

---

## 28. EYEWEAR / SUNGLASSES

### Trying on glasses — mirror moment
```
BAD:  trying on glasses
GOOD: she holds a pair of tortoiseshell acetate glasses in her right hand by
      the right temple arm, positioning them in front of her face about to
      put them on — the glasses are approximately 2 inches from her face with
      the lenses aligned with her eyes. Her left hand is relaxed at her side.
      She looks at her reflection in a mirror (mirror not visible, implied by
      her eye direction). The glasses frames have visible material texture —
      the brown and amber tortoiseshell pattern varies naturally, the hinges
      are a small brass tone. She has a slight evaluating expression, one
      eyebrow slightly raised. Background is a bright retail or home
      environment, shallow depth of field.
```

### Sunglasses — outdoor lifestyle
```
BAD:  wearing sunglasses outside
GOOD: she wears oversized black acetate sunglasses with dark lenses, the frames
      sit on the bridge of her nose and the temples disappear behind her ears
      into her hair. The lenses reflect a subtle, slightly visible ghost image
      of the outdoor scene in front of her — trees and sky, keep the
      reflection abstract and simple. The frame creates a small shadow on her
      cheekbones below the lenses. She has a relaxed half-smile, chin
      slightly lifted. Her hair moves slightly in a breeze. Wearing a white
      linen shirt. The outdoor background is a sunlit street with soft
      bokeh — warm overcast day. The glasses are the sharpest element
      in the frame with the background falling off soft.
```

---

## 29. DENTAL / ORAL CARE

### Toothbrush — in use
```
BAD:  brushing teeth
GOOD: she holds a bamboo toothbrush in her right hand, the brush is at the
      right side of her mouth with bristles contacting her upper right teeth,
      her mouth is slightly open to accommodate the brush, a small amount
      of white toothpaste foam is visible at the corners of her lips and
      on the brush bristles. Her left hand rests on the bathroom counter.
      She looks at herself in the mirror with a natural, slightly amused
      morning expression. Wearing a casual gray tee with messy bed-head hair.
      The bathroom counter has a tube of toothpaste (label facing camera),
      a glass with water, and a small plant. Morning light from the right.
```

### Whitening strips / teeth product
```
BAD:  using whitening strips
GOOD: close-up from nose to chin, she presses a thin translucent whitening
      strip onto her upper teeth with her right index finger, the strip
      is halfway applied — adhered to the left side of her teeth and held
      by her finger on the right side being smoothed into place. Her mouth
      is open showing her upper teeth, the strip material is slightly visible
      as a thin film conforming to the tooth surfaces. Her lips are naturally
      pulled back to expose her teeth. The strip packaging is visible on
      the counter below — a small white pouch with the brand name readable.
      Clean bright bathroom lighting, close crop from nose to collarbone.
```

---

## 30. SEASONAL / HOLIDAY STYLING

### Gift wrapping — product as gift
```
BAD:  wrapping a gift with the product inside
GOOD: a product box sits on a table partially wrapped in cream tissue paper,
      her left hand holds the tissue paper in place while her right hand
      pulls a length of satin ribbon in a dusty rose color. A roll of the
      same ribbon, scissors, and a sprig of dried eucalyptus sit on the
      table beside her workspace. A second already-wrapped gift sits nearby
      — fully wrapped in tissue with a tied bow and eucalyptus sprig tucked
      under the ribbon. The table surface is covered in kraft brown paper.
      The product brand name is visible on the box face peeking out of
      the partially wrapped tissue. Warm indoor holiday lighting —
      a string of fairy lights is slightly visible and blurred in
      the background.
```

### Summer context — product with seasonal cues
```
BAD:  product in a summer setting
GOOD: the product sits on a white cotton beach towel spread on sand, a pair
      of sunglasses rest nearby with one arm folded in, a wide-brim straw
      hat sits upside-down to the right with its crown visible. The product
      casts a short sharp shadow indicating midday overhead sun. A few
      grains of sand are scattered on the towel surface near the product.
      The sand surrounding the towel is fine and golden, the edge of gentle
      turquoise water is barely visible and blurred at the top of the frame.
      Bright harsh direct sunlight creates high contrast — the product
      label is in full sun and readable. The overall color palette is
      warm whites, golds, and turquoise.
```

### Holiday flat lay — gifting context
```
BAD:  holiday flat lay with products
GOOD: overhead shot on a dark green velvet surface. Three products arranged
      in a loose diagonal from upper left to lower right, each wrapped or
      partially wrapped — one in gold tissue paper with the box peeking out,
      one fully visible with a small red satin bow tied around it, one in
      a cream gift bag with tissue paper fanning out of the top. Between
      the products: a few scattered gold star confetti pieces, a small
      pinecone, a cinnamon stick, and a sprig of fresh rosemary. Each item
      casts a soft warm shadow. The velvet surface has a subtle directional
      nap visible in the light. Warm overhead lighting with slight golden
      cast. Product labels are visible and readable where exposed.
```
